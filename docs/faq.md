# FAQ

## How can I upgrade Ollama?

To upgrade Ollama, run the installation process again. On the Mac, click the Ollama icon in the menubar and choose the restart option if an update is available.

## How can I view the logs?

Review the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) docs for more about using logs.

## How do I configure Ollama server?

Ollama server can be configured with environment variables.

### Setting environment variables on Mac

If Ollama is run as a macOS application, environment variables should be set using `launchctl`:

1. For each environment variable, call `launchctl setenv`.

    ```bash
    launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"
    ```

2. Restart Ollama application.

### Setting environment variables on Linux

If Ollama is run as a systemd service, environment variables should be set using `systemctl`:

1. Edit the systemd service by calling `systemctl edit ollama.service`. This will open an editor.

2. For each environment variable, add a line `Environment` under section `[Service]`:

    ```ini
    [Service]
    Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
    ```

3. Save and exit.

4. Reload `systemd` and restart Ollama:

   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart ollama
   ```

## How can I expose Ollama on my network?

Ollama binds 127.0.0.1 port 11434 by default. Change the bind address with the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## How can I allow additional web origins to access Ollama?

Ollama allows cross-origin requests from `127.0.0.1` and `0.0.0.0` by default. Additional origins can be configured with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## Where are models stored?

- macOS: `~/.ollama/models`
- Linux: `/usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\.ollama\models`

### How do I set them to a different location?

If a different directory needs to be used, set the environment variable `OLLAMA_MODELS` to the chosen directory.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## Does Ollama send my prompts and answers back to Ollama.ai to use in any way?

No, Ollama runs entirely locally, and conversation data will never leave your machine.

## How can I use Ollama in Visual Studio Code?

There is already a large collection of plugins available for VSCode as well as other editors that leverage Ollama. See the list of [extensions & plugins](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama#extensions--plugins) at the bottom of the main repository readme.

## How do I use Ollama behind a proxy?

Ollama is compatible with proxy servers if `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` are configured. When using either variables, ensure it is set where `ollama serve` can access the values. When using `HTTPS_PROXY`, ensure the proxy certificate is installed as a system certificate. Refer to the section above for how to use environment variables on your platform.

### How do I use Ollama behind a proxy in Docker?

The Ollama Docker container image can be configured to use a proxy by passing `-e HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com` when starting the container.

Alternatively, the Docker daemon can be configured to use a proxy. Instructions are available for Docker Desktop on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#proxies), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/windows/#proxies), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/linux/#proxies), and Docker [daemon with systemd](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy).

Ensure the certificate is installed as a system certificate when using HTTPS. This may require a new Docker image when using a self-signed certificate.

```dockerfile
FROM ollama/ollama
COPY my-ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-ca.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates
```

Build and run this image:

```shell
docker build -t ollama-with-ca .
docker run -d -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://my.proxy.example.com -p 11434:11434 ollama-with-ca
```

## How do I use Ollama with GPU acceleration in Docker?

The Ollama Docker container can be configured with GPU acceleration in Linux or Windows (with WSL2). This requires the [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit). See [ollama/ollama](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama) for more details.

GPU acceleration is not available for Docker Desktop in macOS due to the lack of GPU passthrough and emulation.

## Why is networking slow in WSL2 on Windows 10?

This can impact both installing Ollama, as well as downloading models.

Open `Control Panel > Networking and Internet > View network status and tasks` and click on `Change adapter settings` on the left panel. Find the `vEthernel (WSL)` adapter, right click and select `Properties`.
Click on `Configure` and open the `Advanced` tab. Search through each of the properties until you find `Large Send Offload Version 2 (IPv4)` and `Large Send Offload Version 2 (IPv6)`. *Disable* both of these
properties.
